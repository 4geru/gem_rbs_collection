aws-sdk signature generator
=====

The signatures in /gems/aws-sdk-* are generated by this generator.

# How to update gems/aws-sdk-* signatures

```
$ rake aws
```

# How it is generated.

[aws/aws-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby) has code generator named [build_tools](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/tree/version-3/build_tools).

This generator uses build_tools to determine the options and types in a similar way to aws-sdk-* gems.

If there is a typing error, it may need to be reported to awk-sdk-ruby.
